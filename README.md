# Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

To securely store and manage configuration settings, create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project. This file will hold environment-specific variables.

Add your environment variables to `.env.local`, such as:

```plaintext
DATABASE_URL=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID =
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET =
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
NEXTAUTH_URL =
